// PROJECT SUMMARY

The Aloha project focused on building  our HTML and CSS skills, while starting with a Mobile-First foundation (I messed up and did desktop first, i learned my lesson!!!). Our main goal was to build a responsive website, from mobile, to tablet, to desktop and adding javascript to make it look NOICE!!!!!!

// PERSON LEARNINGS //

1)Ive learned that spelling is very IMPORTANT because a mispelt word or missing letter or symbol can mess up a whole lot of things.

2)I made a huge mistake by taking this project on by desktop first instead of mobile first and ive learned my lesson because i had to convert all my css from desktop to mobile to accomodate a mobile first approach. it took quite a while converting it but in that process i learned why mobile first IMPORTANT for making a web responsive design.

3)i learned that Javascript syntax has to has to be perfect or else it will not work at all or be broken. at times i was super frustrated with javascript and when i found out my problem was just a missing } i almost went insane

4) i felt fairly confident with the html and css because the lessons taught by jim and rose and extremely indepth and they are just simply AWESOME!!
